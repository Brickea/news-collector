## 📁 Directory Structure

This directory stores daily news digest files generated by the collector.

- **`YYYY-MM-DD.md`** - Current day's digest with the latest news
- **`archive/YYYY/MM/`** - Archived digests organized by year and month
- **`index.md`** - GitHub Pages landing page (auto-generated)
- **`_config.yml`** - Jekyll configuration for GitHub Pages

Each digest file is named `YYYY-MM-DD.md` and contains articles collected on that
date, organized by category and source. Every article title links back to the original URL.

## 🔄 Automatic Updates

Digests are automatically:
- **Generated** daily at 08:00 UTC via GitHub Actions
- **Archived** - older digests are moved to `archive/<YEAR>/<MONTH>/` when `archive.enabled: true` is set in `config/config.yaml`
- **Indexed** - the `index.md` file is regenerated to include all available digests

## 📚 Archive

Browse older digests in the [archive directory](archive/). Archives are organized by year and month for easy navigation:

```
archive/
└── YYYY/
    └── MM/
        └── YYYY-MM-DD.md
```
