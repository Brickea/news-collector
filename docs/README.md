# News Digests

This directory stores daily news digest files generated by the collector.

Each file is named `YYYY-MM-DD.md` and contains the articles collected on that
date, organised by source.  Every article title links back to the original URL.

Older digests are moved to `archive/<YEAR>/<MONTH>/` automatically when
`archive.enabled: true` is set in `config/config.yaml`.
